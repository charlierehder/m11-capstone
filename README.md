This repository contains all of the documentation and code behind the concepts learned as apart of Genesis10 Data Cohort, February 2022. In it we hope to demonstrate an understanding of data literacy, data analysis and data engineering. Everything found in this repository was done by Charlie Rehder, Alysia Halverson and Jakob Thunen.
